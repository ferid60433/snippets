  ## pull.sh
  This script is used to start a `meya-cli watch` process for an existing bot. The script assumes you've already initialized a bot folder locally.

  **NOTE: script assumes your remote code is the ground truth. Local code will be overwritten.**

  1. activate `virtualenv` and update `meya` python package
  2. sync your local code from Meya Cloud Platform.
  3. start a process that continually monitors and sync local file changes (`meya-cli watch`)
