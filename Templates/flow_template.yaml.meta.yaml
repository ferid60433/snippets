    ## Flow template
    This snippet provides the basic format of a Bot Flow Markup Language (BFML) syntax flow file.
    
    Depending on the trigger type, additional trigger settings may be required.
    
    Optionally, you may include an `intents` section for advanced intent routing use-cases.
    
    Note that the `name` parameter is no longer required. If included, it will have no effect; the flow's name comes from the filename.
