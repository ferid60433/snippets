    ## delay_with_an_absolute_time.yaml
    Specify a relative delay in seconds. This is useful when displaying multiple messages to the user. Adding a short relative delay prevents the messages from being displayed too quickly.
    **`delay` is a state-level property, meaning every state supports the delay property.** State-level properties are defined at the same indentation level as the component (see code example above).
