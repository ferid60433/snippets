    ## wit.yaml
    Accepts input from the user and matches it against a pre-trained Wit.ai app. It also extracts entity data and makes that available on `flow` scope.
    ### Properties
    | Property | Description | Required |
    |  :----:  |    :---:    |  :----:  |
    `text`|Text to display to the user. Can include Mustache syntax: `{{ flow.value }}`.|*Required*
    `speech`|Text to speak to the user. This field also accepts SSML markup to customize pronunciation.|*Optional. Defaults to value of `text` property*
    `token`|The Wit.ai token from your Wit.ai app settings.|*Required*
    `require_match`|If `false`, the flow will return the `no_match` action, which you can use to transition to another state.|*Optional. Default: `true`*
    `min_confidence`|The minimum confidence required to match the entity.|*Optional. Default: `0.67`*
    `latch_up`|If `true`, any confidence value greater than `min_confidence` will be rounded up to `1.0`, thus winning any intent collisions.` Confidence values less than `min_confidence` will be rounded down to `0.0`.|`Optional. Default: `false`*
    `scope`|Where to store the data. One of `flow`, `user`, or `bot`.|*Optional. Default: `flow`*
    `buttons`|A YAML list of buttons.|*Optional*
    **The user's intent will be available as `flow.intent`.**
    ### Transitions
    | Transition | Description | Required |
    |   :----:   |    :---:    |  :----:  |
    `next`|If the input matches the Wit.ai app's intent the `next` action is triggered. By default, this will trigger the next state. You can alter this by explicitly setting a transition for the `next` action in the `transitions` section.|*Optional*
    `no_match`|The state to transition to if `require_match` is `false` and the user's input does not match any of the Wit.ai app's intents.|*Optional*
    **You must explicitly handle intents returned from Wit.ai, or your bot will not respond. For example, if the user's input matches a wit.ai intent called `weather`, you must have a matching transition called `weather`.**
