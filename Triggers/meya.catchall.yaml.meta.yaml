    ## meya.catchall
    Will trigger whenever a user says something that hasn't matched to any  other triggers you've specified. A flow launched by the `catchall` trigger can be used to activate a fall back conversation flow.

    Tip: Combine a `catchall` trigger with the `human.transfer` component to have the bot transfer to a human agent when it can't understand the user.
    ### Properties
    *None.*
    ### Flow scope variables
    The `meya.catchall` trigger sets a variable on the `flow` scope. It can be accessed from a flow using Mustache syntax: `{{ flow.value }}`, or from a Python component using `self.db.flow.get("value")`.

    | Variable | Description |
    |   ---    |     ---     |
    `value`|The user's original input.
    `_confidence`|The bot's confidence that this trigger is the best match given the user's input.
