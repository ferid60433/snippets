    ## meya.catchall
    Will trigger whenever a user says something that hasn't matched to any  other triggers you've specified. A flow launched by the `catchall` trigger can be used to activate a fall back conversation flow.

    Tip: Combine a `catchall` trigger with the `human.transfer` component to have the bot transfer to a human agent when it can't understand the user.
    ### Properties
    | Property | Description | Required|
    |    ---   |     ---     |   ---   |
    `detect_language`|If checked, will set `flow.language` to the language the input was written in.|*Optional. Default: `false`*
    ### Flow scope variables
    The `meya.catchall` trigger sets a variable on the `flow` scope. It can be accessed from a flow using Mustache syntax: `{{ flow.value }}`, or from a Python component using `self.db.flow.get("value")`.

    | Variable | Description |
    |   ---    |     ---     |
    `value`|The user's original input.
    `_confidence`|The bot's confidence that this trigger is the best match given the user's input.
    ### Example
    Create a new flow `language.yaml`. Paste the following code into the flow.
    ```
    triggers:
        - type: meya.catchall
        properties:
            detect_language: true
    name: language
    states:
        first:
            component: meya.text
            properties:
                text: "Your language is {{ flow.language }}"
    ```
    Enter `hello` and the bot will respond `Your language is en`. If you enter `bonjour` the bot should respond `Your language is fr`.
    Now set `detect_language` to `false` in the trigger properties. Enter `hello` or `bonjour` and the bot will respond `Your language is` since it didn't detect the language.
