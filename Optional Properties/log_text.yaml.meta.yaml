    ## log_text
    Write a custom log message from any state. The message will appear in the **Logs** panel.
    
    This is a simplified version of the state-level `log` property. `status` and `type` are automatically set to `info` and `misc`, respectively.
    
    **`log_text` is a state-level property, meaning every state supports the log_text property.** State-level properties are defined at the same indentation level as the component (see code example above).
    ### Properties
