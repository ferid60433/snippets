    ## API request
    This component demonstrates how to make an API call and return the results to the user.

    Create a flow containing a single state that calls this component.
    ```
    triggers:
      - type: keyword
        settings:
            ignorecase: true
            keyword: hi
    states:
        first:
            component: api_request
    ```

    Type `hi` and the bot will respond with a joke.
