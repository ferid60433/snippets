    | Property | Description | Required |
    |   ----   |     ---     |   ----   |
    `text`|Text to display to the user. Can include Mustache syntax: `{{ flow.value }}`.|*Optional*
    `speech`|Text to speak to the user. This field also accepts SSML markup to customize pronunciation.|*Optional. Defaults to value of `text` property*
    `output`|The key used to store the data for subsequent steps in the flow.|*Optional. Default: `value`*
    `scope`|Where to store the data. One of `flow`, `user`, or `bot`.|*Optional. Default: `flow`*

    ### Transitions
    When the user submits their response, the `next` action is triggered. By default, this will trigger the next state. You can alter this by explicitly setting a transition for the `next` action in the `transitions` section.
    ### Example - Language Detection
    You can use the `meya.input_string` component to detect a user's language. Create a new flow called `language.yaml` and paste the following code.
    ```
    triggers:
      - type: meya.catchall
        properties:
            detect_language: false
    states:
        first:
            component: meya.text
            properties:
                text: "Your language is {{ flow.language }}"

        input_state:
            component: meya.input_string
            properties:
                text: "Enter some text"
                detect_language: true
                output: value
                scope: flow

        greeting:
            component: meya.text
            properties:
                text: "Your language is {{ flow.language }}"
    ```
    Test it out in the test chat window. Entering `hello` will match the `catchall` trigger and start the flow. The bot will say `Your language is` since it hasn't yet detected your language. Enter `hello` again and the bot will respond `Your language is en`. Clear the messages to start over. This time try entering `bonjour`. The bot will respond `Your language is fr`.
